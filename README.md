# Code Review and Refactoring Tool

## Overview
The **Code Review and Refactoring Tool** is a **JSON-based static code analysis tool** designed to review C++ source files and identify potential issues such as **missing semicolons, deep nesting, long functions, poor indentation, and unused variables**. The tool provides **structured JSON output**, making it easy to integrate with other applications or CI/CD pipelines.

## Introduction
This project aims to **automate code review** by detecting common mistakes and inefficiencies in C++ code. The tool scans input files, applies **regex-based pattern matching**, and reports issues in a structured **JSON format**. The output can be used for **automated refactoring suggestions, debugging assistance, and code quality assurance**.

## Features
✅ Detects **missing semicolons** in C++ code  
✅ Identifies **deeply nested code** for better readability  
✅ Flags **long functions** that may need refactoring  
✅ Detects **poor indentation** to improve formatting  
✅ Reports **unused variables** to optimize memory usage  
✅ Outputs **JSON-formatted reports** for easy integration  
✅ Provides **line number references** for detected issues  

## Functional Requirements
- **Code Analysis:** The tool should scan C++ source files for potential issues.
- **JSON Output:** Generate structured reports in JSON format.
- **Error Detection:** Identify missing semicolons, deep nesting, long functions, indentation issues, and unused variables.
- **Integration:** Should be easily integrable with other applications.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:** The tool should analyze files quickly.
- **Scalability:** Should work on both small scripts and large C++ projects.
- **Usability:** Simple command-line interface for easy usage.
- **Accuracy:** High detection rate for common coding mistakes.

## System Design & Implementation

### Architecture
The tool follows a **modular design**:
- **Lexical Analysis:** Parses the input C++ file.
- **Pattern Matching:** Uses **regex** to identify coding issues.
- **JSON Formatter:** Formats output for structured reporting.
- **Report Generator:** Outputs a final JSON report with detected issues.

### Code Analysis Mechanism
- **Missing Semicolons:** Regex pattern to detect missing semicolons.
- **Deep Nesting:** Tracks nesting depth based on `{` and `}` count.
- **Long Functions:** Counts the number of lines inside a function.
- **Indentation Issues:** Checks for inconsistent leading spaces.
- **Unused Variables:** Matches declared variables and checks their usage.

## Sample Output
```json
{
  "issues": [
    {"line": 11, "message": "Possible missing semicolon."},
    {"line": 19, "message": "Possible missing semicolon."},
    {"message": "Code may be deeply nested. Consider refactoring."}
  ]
}
```

## Installation & Usage
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/code-review-tool.git
   cd code-review-tool
   ```
2. **Compile the tool:**
   ```sh
   g++ -o analyzer analyzer.cpp
   ```
3. **Run the analysis:**
   ```sh
   ./analyzer sample.cpp
   ```

## Future Enhancements
- ✅ Support for additional programming languages (Python, Java, etc.)
- ✅ GUI-based visualization for issue reports
- ✅ Integration with GitHub Actions for automated PR reviews
- ✅ AI-based code improvement suggestions
- ✅ Enhanced detection for complex coding patterns

## Conclusion
The **Code Review and Refactoring Tool** provides an automated, JSON-based analysis of C++ code, helping developers identify and resolve common issues efficiently. It enhances **code quality, readability, and maintainability**, making it a valuable tool for developers and teams.
